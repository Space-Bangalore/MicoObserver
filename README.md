MicoObserver
============

It is about observing microbial activities in hydrogen rich environment as to understand the growth of microbes in space.

We started with the electrolysis of brine. Why? As outer space environment is hydrogen rich low pressure environment, so as to create an environment we need hydrogen and electrolysis of brine gives chlorine and hydrogen as its by-products. For electrolysis we took an air tight jar, two copper wires(electrodes), salt water solution and two clear pipes(to collect both the gasses).

This is how our one job done.

 

The next thing to do is the observation of microbes. For that we needed microscope, which was an another job altogether. We made a microscope by a webcam, just by inverting the lens of webcam. That that microscope is fixed in a container having an inlet for hydrogen and an outlet through which other gasses present in the container can escape. Just below the microscope we kept a slide of sample, samples were taken from wet places having algae and other microbes.

 

Connecting the webcam converted in microscope to laptop helped us to have a look on the activities of microbes in our sample.

For streaming that video we used already existing web application called ustream and linked it with tumbler webpage.
